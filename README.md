# Description 

This is very simple node-based server that controls **nginx** (add/remove HTTP reverse proxy records) using REST API.

Development-only, Mac-only. 

# Usage 

## proxy target auto-discovery

```
curl -X PUT http://192.168.64.1:1081/proxy/[endpoint]/port/[port]
```
 
will add host with [endpoint] name (port 80) and forward all traffic to host that called curl 
(docker-machine) and specified port. 

example: **http://192.168.64.1:1081/proxy/myhost.local/port/8080**


## specifying URL 


```
curl -X PUT http://192.168.64.1:1081/proxy/[endpoint]/to-http-url/[host-and-port]
```
 
will add host with [endpoint] name (port 80) and forward all traffic to [host-and-port] (http)

example: **http://192.168.64.1:1081/proxy/myhost.local/to-http-url/192.168.1.11%3a8080**

## xip.io support 


Just use ".__xip.io" zone to create [xip.io](http://xip.io) proxy host. 

Example: **curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:1081/proxy/test.__xip.io/to-port/8080**

After this you can use http://test.127.0.0.1.xip.io/


## DELETE works too

curl -X DELETE http://192.168.64.1:1081/proxy/[endpoint]


# Installation 

- you will need to install nginx on your Mac (brew install nginx)
- run npm install (will ask for sudo)
- start service: npm start  (no autostart configration yet, you will need to create your own launchd file) 



# Production Alternatives

- hey, this thing might be ok for production after some work (tests, tls, security, etc). Mostly this is just plain nginx, and nginx is certanly good for production. 
- Perhaps [kong](https://getkong.org/) can similar things 
- [Commerical nginx](https://www.nginx.com/products/) product might be OK too
